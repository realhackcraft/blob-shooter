# Blob-Shooter

Blob Shooter is a third-person-shooter game where you shoot blobs.

## Controls

The controls are `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` or arrow keys.

Additionally, you can sprint by holding down `space`.

Use your mouse to shoot colored blobs: if you touch them, you die!

Powerups may appear once in a while, collect them to get temporary bonuses.
